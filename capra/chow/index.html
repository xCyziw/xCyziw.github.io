            <h1>Origin</h1>
            <p>The Chow Chow is an ancient dog breed that originated in Northern China 2000-3000 years ago, where it was bred
                as a working dog for hunting, herding, and guarding. Known for its distinctive stilted gait and lion's mane
                ruff; its deep-set almond shaped eyes; and its characteristic black tongue, this breed boasts a powerful,
                dignified presence.
            </p>
            <p>As a member of the spitz family, the Chow Chow is related to the Samoyed, Siberian Husky, Shiba Inu, Malamute,
                Akita, Pomeranian, and Keeshond, among others. It is likely that other spitz breeds evolved from the Chow
                Chow.

    <!-- CARE -->
    <section class="pt-3 m-3">
        <div class="container">
            <h1 id="care">Care</h1>
            <p>Chow Chows are strong-willed and independent, but they are also fiercely loyal and protective. They often earn
                a bad rap for being aggressive, but this is mostly a result of inexperienced or unprepared owners. If well-socialized
                and trained, they are among the best breeds – not only because of their lovable personality, but also because
                they’re clean, quiet, and adaptable.
            </p>
            <h2>Before You Adopt</h2>
            <p>Before considering adopting, research. It is crucial for a Chow puppy to be socialized with dogs and people in
                various settings. This way, it will grow accustomed to strangers and be less likely to be aggressive. Raising
                a puppy is like raising a child, only for a shorter period of time; the owner needs to commit the time to
                train the puppy, so that he/she can establish authority and set boundaries. Because Chows do not respond
                as eagerly to being trained, they are generally not a good breed for first-time dog owners. This is the case
                especially if adopting an adult Chow. Generally, it is best to practice positive reinforcement, since Chows
                do not respond particularly well to punishment because of their independent nature.
            </p>
            <h2>Regular Care</h2>
            <p>Overall, Chows are quite low-maintenance. They rarely bark and only require moderate to low amounts of exercise,
                making them well-suited for apartment living. Because they have a thick double coat, their skin stays clean;
                as such, they should only be bathed 2-3 times per year. However, it is important that they be brushed regularly,
                and groomed fairly often. Otherwise, their fur can get matted and dirty – not to mention, brushing and de-shedding
                keeps the house less furry.
            </p>
            <h2>Health Concerns</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">In most cases, Chows are a healthy breed. Like all breeds, they occasionally suffer from hip or elbow dysplasia
                or acquire eye diseases. If adopting a puppy, work with a responsible breeder to ensure good health practices.
                To help prevent glaucoma, it is important that owners walk their Chows with harnesses, rather than collars.
                This will reduce unnecessary pressure on the eyes and prevent choking if they pull.
